# 📊 PRODIGY_DS_Task2 – Exploratory Data Analysis on credit risk

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a synthetic credit risk dataset to uncover insights into patterns and relationships that affect loan delinquency risk.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and handle missing values
- Analyze variable distributions and relationships
- Identify key risk indicators for delinquency
- Support potential predictive modeling and business insights

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📉 **Delinquency Risk by Credit Utilization**: Customers with credit utilization ratios above 0.6 show a significantly higher chance of becoming delinquent.
- 💰 **Income vs Delinquency**: Individuals with income levels below ₹40,000 tend to default more frequently compared to higher-income brackets.
- 🧑‍💼 **Employment Status Influence**: Unemployed and retired individuals exhibit the highest delinquency rates, while employed customers are the least likely to default.
- 🧮 **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: High DTI values correlate with elevated risk, suggesting over-leveraged customers are more likely to fall behind on payments.
- 🎓 **Education & Financial Behavior**: Customers with lower educational backgrounds show a slightly higher default risk, indicating a potential awareness or financial literacy gap.
- 📊 **Correlation Patterns**:
  - Credit utilization and income are **negatively correlated**.
  - Loan amount and delinquency have a **positive relationship**.
- 📍 **Geographical/Residential Patterns**: Renters are more likely to default than homeowners, possibly due to financial instability.
- ⚠️ **Missing Data Observations**: Key fields like `employment_status` and `loan_purpose` had missing values, which were handled through imputation to preserve data integrity.
